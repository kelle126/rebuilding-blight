					<h3>Why You Should Care</h3>
					<p>Urban blight can have many negative affects on the community it is located in. Instead of a harmonious  neighborhood, people are often unhappy with their living situation and the eyesores that taint their once beautiful neighborhoods.
					</p>	
					<h3>Causes and Effects</h3>
					<p>Urban blight spreads very quickly in communities unless action is taken quickly. Blighted buildings often harbor crime, such as theft, drug use, and squatting. This decreases the morale of the community as well as put the people that live within them at risk of participating in or falling victim to these crimes.
					</p>
					<h3>Why Taking Action is Difficult</h3>
					<p>Often blighted communities exist where there are high unemployment and poverty rates. Without sufficient finances it is nearly impossible to remove or improve urban blight.
