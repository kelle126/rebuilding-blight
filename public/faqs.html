					<h3><u>Email interview with Dan Gilbert</u></h3>
					<dl>
						<dt><b>What guided your decision to take on this massive project? Emotional?- is there a story?</b></dt>
						<dd>Thank you for your note. Blight is an extraordinarily important topic, and I am glad that you have decided to take on a problem that so many see as insurmountable. I am not one of those people – we can and must put our best talent and ideas forward until we stop the spread of blight and allow Detroit to grow and prosper as it should.</dd>
						<dd>My family has called Detroit home for the past four generations. In fact, my grandfather owned a carwash in the city, my father ran a bar, and now Quicken Loans is headquartered in downtown Detroit. I have seen Detroit through good and bad times, so I know the potential of the city. With any blight in the picture, that potential can never be met.</dd>
						
						<dt><b>What is the greatest challenge in getting rid of the blight?</b></dt>
						<dd>Blight is a cancerous cycle that increases crime, inhibits development, and sucks the energy and life out of the surrounding areas. Even one blighted property has a dramatic snowball effect in the neighborhood, and Detroit is 140 square miles – that is large enough to fit San Francisco, Manhattan and Boston and still have room to spare. Unquestionably, the biggest obstacle to completely eradicating blight is the combination of the cyclical nature and the sheer quantity of blight in Detroit.</dd>
 						<dd>When we decided to take on blight, our first move was to inventory the entire city. After all, how can you solve a problem if you don’t know where to start? We surveyed approximately 380,000 buildings and parcels in Detroit, and nearly 90,000 parcels were classified as blight. (Here is an interactive map of what we found, and here is the report that we generated.)</dd>
						<dd>To date, just over 10,000 of these properties have been demolished. But because blight is cyclical, more blight has been created since our initial survey. This is why our new goal is to make a big commitment to eradicate all residential blight in Detroit by 2026.</dd>
						<dd>Quicken Loans and our Family of Companies has made a big start by helping to secure federal funding (called Hardest Hit Funds), which can be used for residential demolitions in certain investment zones within the city. We have also partnered with the Detroit Land Bank Authority and Home Depot in a program called Rehabbed & Ready, which rehabs houses in strategically selected areas and sell them back on the market. This not only gets rid of a blighted house, but also creates a market comp that helps to raise market values in the city. There have been 21 sales so far, and we are committed to many more.</dd>
						
						<dt><b>Have you run into anyone who wanted to stop some part of the project? If so, what part did they want to stop?</b></dt>
						<dd>It has not always been an easy process – obstacles like funding limitations, break-ins, and political barriers. However, we are resolute in our knowledge that blight must be eradicated, so we will continue to find solutions regardless of the impediment.
						</dd>
						<dd>For the past 6 years, much of our time has been focused on eliminating blight in the downtown area and regenerating the energy and excitement. From this, we have seen unbelievable benefits – notably, people want to be downtown again, and this has pushed everyone from City government to private business to both grow and prosper themselves and see the unquestionable potential in the city of Detroit.  
						 </dd>
						
						<dt><b>What is the greatest benefit you have seen come from this transformation?</b></dt>
						<dd>Of course, we know that an urban core and the neighborhoods are two pieces of one whole – one does not function properly without healthy activity in the other. We know that by eliminating blight in the neighborhoods, the same benefits will come. Residents will see their home values increase (in fact, we know that for every dollar put into demolition, we see between $4.27 and $8.25 in economic benefit), and they will be able to live and grow alongside the city.</dd>

						<br />
						<dt><b>"We are moving in the right direction on blight removal and the future of Detroit is bright. Our strong public-private partnerships are helping to write the next chapter in the history of this great American city."</b></dt>

					<h3><u>Email interview with Housing of Urban Development (Michigan contact- Keith Hernandez)</u></h3>
					<dl></dl>
						<dt><b>Is dealing with urban blight regulated by the state as a whole or by city or district?</b></dt>
						<dd>Dealing with blight is the responsibility of the individual local units of government.  They determine a course of action on a local level and decide how to fund activities to tackle blight.  In many cases, those funds come from HUD to use in areas identified through census data as being at or below 80% of the Area Median Income, the area being defined by the census.</dd>
						
						<dt><b>How is the disbursement of funds decided?</b></dt>
						<dd>The Community Development Block Grant funds are distributed based on a formula.  The formula is complex, but the key components that are being looked at are population, population growth lag, poverty rate, percentage of pre-World War II housing stock, and percentage of overcrowded units (number of people greater than a unit’s capacity per square foot of living area)</dd>
						
						<dt><b>How is blight reported to the government, is it reported by individuals or do officials go and search out blighted areas?</b></dt>
						<dd>Both ways are effective and both ways are used.  For the most part, since the assessment is done on a local basis, everyone who lives and works in an area knows where the blight is in a given community.</dd>
						
						<dt><b>How is it decided what is done with the blighted buildings?</b></dt>
						<dd>Once again, it is a local decision. There can be full rehabilitation to a building’s former use, adaptive reuse of a building from one use to another use, or demolition.  The decision is based on number of factors: building condition, historical relevance, community will, external or internal commercial interests, and so forth.</dd>

						<dt><b>What tends to cause urban blight?</b></dt>
						<dd>The cause of urban blight is neglect.  The reasons for that neglect are endless.  Primarily, I would say urban blight is caused by mass disinvestment.  This is usually due to either financial strain placed on investors/residents feel that further investment is certain property would be foolish either economically (property values are dropping) or due to the diminishment of the quality of their lives.</dd>

						<dt><b>Does the government feel like they are responsible for dealing with the blight or do they believe it should be a more community based solution?</b></dt>
						<dd>Certainly the government feels like they play a role in dealing with blight.  HUD assists communities every day to deal with blight.  But there is a component to our involvement that makes it mandatory for the decision to be local.  Every year, we ask our CDBG recipients to provide us with a plan on how they will expend the grant funds.  That plan has a public comment/involvement component that is mandatory.  The local unit of government must give proper notice any and all public meetings on the plan and receive public comment or HUD will reject the plan.  The local government will not be funded for blight activity that has not gone through the public comment period.  It is a partnership.  We provide oversight, but the decisions on how and where to use the funds are local.</dd>
